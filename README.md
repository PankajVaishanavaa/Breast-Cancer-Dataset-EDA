Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data analysis that enables researchers and data analysts to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within a dataset. In the context of cancer research, EDA plays a vital role in identifying correlations between various factors and understanding the distribution of key variables among patients. This analysis is performed on the Breast Cancer dataset using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. By leveraging visualization tools, EDA helps in representing data through meaningful plots and tabulations, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dataset.
